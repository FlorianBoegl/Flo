- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlorianBoegl
- I’m interested in math, physics, coding and technical stuff in general
- I also like to travel and learn from different cultures, so I have traveled to many different countries
- For example two of the more exotic countries (from a German perspective) I have traveled to are Australia (not Austria! :P) and Chile
- I’m currently learning computer science as a bachelor student at the university TH-Rosenheim.
- Currently I am in the fourth Semester.
- At the moment I have a lot of fun coding, I try to learn from many resources inside and outside of university.
- But the deeper I go into computer science and the more I learn, the more I feel like paraphrasing Socrates: "For I am conscience that I practically know nothing..."
