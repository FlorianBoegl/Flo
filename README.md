- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FlorianBoegl
- Iâ€™m interested in math, physics, coding and technical stuff in general
- I also like to travel and learn about different cultures so I have traveled to many different countries
- For example some more exotic countries (from a German perspective) I have traveled to are Australia (not Austria! :P), Costa Rica and Chile and many more
- Iâ€™m currently learning computer science as a student at TH-Rosenheim
- At the moment I have a lot of fun coding, I try to learn from many resources inside and outside of the university, like for everybody else the most significant constraint is time.
-  I often feel I don't have enough time to learn the amount of knoweledge humanity has amassed, at least the things I have learned in the past couple of years seem so easy and obvious now. 
- The only thing I am absolutely sure of is that I don't know anything at all
