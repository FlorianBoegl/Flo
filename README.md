- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Flo
- Iâ€™m interested in math, physics, coding and technical stuff in general
- I also like to travel and learn from different cultures, so I have traveled to many different countries
- For example two of the more exotic countries (from a German perspective) I have traveled to are Australia (not Austria! :P) and Chile
- Iâ€™m currently learning computer science as a bachelor student at the university TH-Rosenheim.
- Currently I am in the fourth Semester.
- At the moment I have a lot of fun coding, I try to learn from many resources inside and outside of university.
- The more I learn about computer science and the deeper I go, the more I feel like paraphrasing Socrates: "For I am conscience that I practically know nothing..."
- So there is still a lot of studying/learning I will have to do, and that will probably never change... :)
