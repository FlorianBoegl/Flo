- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FlorianBoegl
- Iâ€™m interested in math, physics, coding and technical stuff in general
- I also like to travel and have been in many different countries
- For example some more exotic countries from a German perspective I have visited are Australia (not Austria! I have been there as well many time ;) ) and Chile 
- Iâ€™m currently learning computer science as a student at TH-Rosenheim
- At the moment I have a lot of fun coding, I try to learn from many resources inside and outside of the university
