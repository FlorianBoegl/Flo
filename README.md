- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FlorianBoegl
- Iâ€™m interested in math, physics, coding and technical stuff in general
- I also like to travel and learn from different cultures, so I have traveled to many different countries
- For example two of the more exotic countries (from a German perspective) I have traveled to are Australia (not Austria! :P) and Chile
- Iâ€™m currently learning computer science as a student at TH-Rosenheim
- At the moment I have a lot of fun coding, I try to learn from many resources inside and outside of the university.
- I often feel I don't have enough time to learn the amount of knoweledge humanity has amassed, especially in the domain of computer science.
- At least the things I have learned in the past couple of years seem so easy and obvious now. 
- But the more I learn the more I feel like paraphrasing Socrates: "For I am conscience that I practically know nothing..."
